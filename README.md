# Remote Pi Bartender - android code

This repository is one of two parts of the project *Remote Pi Bartender*, built by students at the university of applied sciences Neu-Ulm.

The project acts as a base for a seminar paper written in context of the lecture *Future Cars*, supervised by [Mr. Prof. Plechaty](https://www.hs-neu-ulm.de/manfred-plechaty/).

Research background was the question, if it was possible to extend the [original project *Smart Bartender*](https://github.com/HackerShackOfficial/Smart-Bartender) with a remote control.
This has been achieved successfully using the mqtt-communication protocol.
